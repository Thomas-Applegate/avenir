# avenir
A simple c++ concurrency library
This is a project I am doing to learn and is still very much a work in progress. It is probably not suitable for production enviroments.

Features will include:

* basic thread pool
* promises and futures
* continuations
* future composition (wait_for_any, wait_for_all)
